#### What is order?
Order is a versatile task runner / build system created to assist with the project development and maintance processes.

It's main goal is to give to the developer:
- script definition file with clear and intuitive structure
- task-based subcommands
    - **[not yet implemented]** with support for user-defined flagset
- **[not yet implemented]** task inheritance which provides:
    - centralization of common task code (multirepo project support)
    - ability to divide tasks into file-based, aliased namespaces
    - support for parent task checksum validation
    - optional separation between definition and implementation
    - compliation of whole inheritance tree to single file
